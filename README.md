OK-JacksonCoDems Website

🇺🇸 Project Overview

This repository hosts the source code for the official static website of the Oklahoma Jackson County Democratic Party (OK-JacksonCoDems).

The goal of this project is to provide a public, easily accessible resource for local Democrats, voters, and interested citizens to find key information about the party, upcoming events, official documents, and contact details.

🌟 Key Features

    Informational Hub: Provides general information about the Jackson County Democratic Party.

    Agendas and Minutes: Dedicated section (agendas.html and agendas/) for publishing meeting agendas and other official documents.

    Simple & Accessible: Built with standard HTML and CSS for quick loading and broad accessibility.

    Copyable for any Precinct or other County Party

💻 Technical Stack

The project utilizes a minimal, standard web stack:

    HTML5 (Structure and content)

    CSS3 (Styling)

The repository structure suggests the site initialized from the dieghernan/chulapa-101 template, but we have re-coded everything since then and
exploring unforking not to create any confusion.
